# my-first-js-app

## This is my first JavaScript Application


### Objective:
---
**Building a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads
data from an external API and enables the viewing of data points in detail.**



### User Goals:
---
The user should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
The details for each item shall be:
- the Pokémon name
- the Pokémon front picture
- the Pokémon hight
- the Pokémon type



### Key Features:
---
- Load data from an external source (API)
- View a list of items
- On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item



## Technical Requirements

### Required:
---
- The app shall load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
- The app shall display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
- The app shall enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
- The app shall have CSS styling.
- The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
  - The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
  - The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
- The app shall use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or touch interactions.
  - The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
- The app shall not throw any errors when being used.
- The app shall be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, & Web Hosting).
- The app shall work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
